# Decentralized-Exchange
I created my very own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) mainly to hone my skills, potentially opening future possibilities in the long run.

This DEX was made using the Ethereum blockchain while mainly using Solidity as the coding language to build the smart contracts responsible for creating this DEX. The contracts include one for the ERC20 token and another for the Decentralized Exchange itself.
